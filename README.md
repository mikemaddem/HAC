HAC

Update: 4/26/2022 - the project will be continued this summer the earliest but at the latest this fall as I complete independent studies on video game anticheats.

What am I doing with this project?
- Great question, not too much except to prove to companies and organizations that 
anticheats are not difficult given a skilled person with dedication. Not that its easy, 
but that many organizations do little to combat this issue.

How is this enforced?
- I'll be creating a metamod plugin when the client has reached a stable stage that will
authenticate that the client is running on the users machine
